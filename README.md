# Sales
Tried to do some cool and fun stuffs with the python PANDAS library (using those command and syntax to see how they actually works) that I learnt.

"Sales.CSV" is the final xlsx file that I saved the pandas dataframe into a excel file.

Except of that 'Sales.csv' file, the rest of the files are the sales file throughout the year which I collected from kaggle.com

It's just something that I did during my learning period about two and a half month ago. Just uploaded it for future referances.
